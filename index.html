        <p>Hello! My name is Jensen Westraad and I am from Cape Town, South Africa. I am a first year student at
            BYU-Idaho, where I am currently studying Web Development. I love music and really enjoy playing piano and
            singing, while I also love to teach myself more about film-making in my free time! I am looking forward to
            improving my knowledge of Web Development with this course and I hope to create websites of my own one day
            that will help meet multiple types of needs. Im always excited to learn new things and I can't wait to see
            what my future holds! </p>
